    "# Modern Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll cover \"modern\" neural networks.  In this case that specifically means deep, residual, convolutional neural networks.  Notably, the field of machine learning is \"moving on\" a bit these days from convoltutional neural networks.  The latest models are what are called \"transformers\" - we won't cover them today or likely at all in this course, but they certainly claim to be the next Big Thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Today's tutorial Agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover 3 things in the tutorial-focused portion of today's session:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) ImageNet Dataset, from a high view.  (More next week!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Recap of Convolutions, and the vanishing gradient problem\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Residual Layers and the ResNet development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) ImageNet from a Mile High\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2010s, there was one dataset to rule them all: [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/).  We will use this dataset for the rest of this series since it's the territory of \"Big Data.\"  The dataset is just about 200GB on disk, and contains 1.4M images to classify spread over 1000 classes.  Modern datasets from science are actually growing even bigger!  For today, we will use the data loading as a *black box*, paying no heed to how we're loading the data or what it's doing.  We will circle back next week, however, to get into this."
